This is a simple program that allows you to search for songs that you like based on a keyword search. What it will do is allow you to create a playlist that will automatically load and can be adjusted everytime you open it. Creating this program required the use of primarily HTML, CSS, and JS.The JS portion required the implementation of the SoundCloud API and a series of keyword event listeners to track what you have inputted into the kw search. Feel free to clone the file and try it out for yourself!
